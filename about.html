        <p class="body">J Zimmerman is a Graduate Student in Wayne State's School of Information Science and a candidate for a Masters degree in Library and Information Science. After grauating from the University of Arkansas in 2014 with a Bachelors
          degree in History and Creative Writing, J worked a variety of jobs including pizza chef, preschool teacher, General Maintenance, and Handyman before deciding to seek further education. He hopes to graduate in May of 2020 and find a job as a
          librarian at his local library or one of the campus libraries in town. He is very familiar with local trails and history, having earned his Eagle Scout rank in Boy Scouts in 2009 after working with the Shiloh Museum of Ozark History. In his
          free time, J enjoys writing, playing guitar, taking care of his dogs, woodworking, gardening, and playing computer games. He also enjoys spending time in nature whether it's taking his dogs for a walk or taking a hike in the nearby Ozark
          hills.
