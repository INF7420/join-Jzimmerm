# Zimmerman 7420 Project

I intend to turn this webpage into an online portfolio which I can change to fit my needs as time goes on.  As an aspiring writer, this is something I've needed for many years and just put off.  Hopefully I will be able to craft something that can be submitted as an e-portfolio for graduation and as a showcase of my work for potential jobs or publishing post graduation.

## Wireframes

Included in this section are Wireframes of potential designs for the finished project. I have considered creating dropdown menus for navigation as well as a few types of multimedia to display for the portfolio.  These features will change as the semester moves forward and I figure out my coding limitations.

This page will serve the purpose of connecting me with potential employers and other interested parties. It includes a header with Images and the page name as well as navigation hyperlinks.  The body of the page includes a list of my personal contact information, a calendar which will provide any information on relevant events I may be attending, and an email widget included to let people send an email without leaving the page.
